Run ECC with Hill cypher.py file 
open localhost in browser 127.0.0.1:5000
Run Security analysis.py file to find the comparisions between the encrypted and decrypted image and original image
Static/images consists of all the images.
Sample images -> Images from dataset
Encrypted images -> Encrypted images are saved in this folder
Decrypted images -> Decrypted images are saved in this folder
NOTE: images should have  dimensions divisible by 4
i.e 256x256 or 500x500
this is because we use small windows of 4x4 for encryption
